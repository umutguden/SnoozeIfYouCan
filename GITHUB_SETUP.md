Title: [Open Source] Snooze If You Can - iOS Alarm App with Charitable Donations (Archived)

I've just open-sourced my iOS alarm app project that demonstrates using Apple's new AlarmKit framework. The concept is simple: every time you snooze, you donate to charity, with costs escalating ($0.99 to $9.99) to discourage excessive snoozing.

**Key Features:**
- SwiftUI + MVVM architecture
- AlarmKit integration with UserNotifications fallback
- StoreKit 2 for in-app purchases
- CloudKit sync
- Full localization and accessibility support

**Why Archived:**
The project is currently archived because AlarmKit isn't production-ready yet (no simulator support, unclear entitlements, reliability issues). It's more of a reference implementation and learning resource at this stage.

**What's Inside:**
- ~5,000 lines of Swift 6.0 code
- Comprehensive documentation (11 markdown files)
- Clean architecture following iOS best practices
- Complete feature set (just needs reliable AlarmKit)

**For Developers:**
If you're interested in AlarmKit, this project shows how to implement it with proper fallbacks. It also demonstrates StoreKit 2, CloudKit, and modern SwiftUI patterns.
